The Terraform Provider for (Linux Operating) System allows managing files, directories, users, groups, packages, and services on remote servers on operating system level agent-less via SSH.

> Even in a cloud-native heaven ‚òÅÔ∏è, there will still be use cases for pets üêà

## Highlights

* Manage files, directories, users, groups, packages, and services on remote servers
* Connect to and authenticate with remote servers via SSH
* No agent on remote server required
* Seamless integration with Terraform providers of [all major IaaS cloud providers](examples)
* Support for Debian, Alpine, and Fedora Linux confirmed via acceptance test suite

## Quick Starts

- [Using the provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/robbert229/system/latest/docs)
- [Examples](examples)

## Use Cases

The provider aims to allow configuring individual remote servers according to *mutable infrastructure* approach. You might find your use case in the following non-exhaustive list:

* Individual servers or virtual machines which are not recreated when configuration changes
* Share or distribute server or virtual machine configuration as using Terraform modules

The provider is not suitable for *immutable infrastructure* approaches such as fleets of homogeneous virtual machines. In this case, you may consider a more suitable configuration mechanism.

## User documentation

Refer to the comprehensive [user documentation of the provider in the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/robbert229/system/latest/docs).
